Histoire : Cinderella lives with her stepmother and her half-sisters after her dad dies. Nobody loves her and they treat her as a slave. While her sisters and her stepmom enjoy dances in palaces and nice clothes, Cinderella has to stay home dirty and in old clothes, doing all the housework. One night, the Prince throws a big party and all the sisters are excited to go so that they can meet the charming Prince and maybe marry him. Cinderella wishes she could go too but she has nothing to wear and she is desperate. 


Avis : A nice story that gives hope to people in difficult situations but it presents women as though need to be saved by some prince who will marry them. Other than that, it states that love can win over evil in the end.
